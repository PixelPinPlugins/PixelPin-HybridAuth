# PixelPin-HybridAuth

HybridAuth enables developers to easily build social applications and tools
to engage websites visitors and customers on a social level by implementing
social sign-in, social sharing, users profiles, friends list, activities
stream, status updates and more.

The main goal of HybridAuth is to act as an abstract API between your application
and various social apis and identities providers such as Facebook, Twitter and Google.
